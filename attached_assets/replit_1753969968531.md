## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with context-based user management

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Development**: Hot reloading with Vite middleware in development
- **Production**: Static file serving with Express

### Database & ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon Database)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript support
- **Schema**: Shared schema definitions between client and server
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-in and email/password
- **Authorization**: JWT token verification on server routes
- **Session Management**: Firebase Auth state persistence
- **User Context**: React Context API for user state management

### AI Integration
- **Provider**: Google Gemini AI (version 2.5-flash)
- **Architecture**: Server-side AI processing for security
- **Profession Prompts**: Customized system prompts per profession type
- **Credit System**: Token-based usage tracking for AI interactions

### Chat System
- **Real-time**: HTTP-based chat with optimistic updates
- **Message Storage**: PostgreSQL with session-based organization
- **UI**: Modern chat interface with typing indicators and message history
- **Credit Tracking**: AI usage costs tracked per message

### Admin Dashboard
- **Access Control**: Admin-only routes with role-based permissions
- **Analytics**: User statistics, message counts, and credit usage tracking
- **User Management**: View and manage registered users

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Firebase handles authentication, server validates tokens
2. **Session Creation**: Users select profession, creating new chat sessions
3. **Message Processing**: User messages sent to server, processed by Gemini AI
4. **Response Delivery**: AI responses returned with credit deduction
5. **Data Persistence**: Messages and sessions stored in PostgreSQL
6. **State Management**: React Query caches and synchronizes server state

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **Firebase**: Authentication, user management
- **Google Gemini AI**: Natural language processing and generation
- **Neon Database**: Managed PostgreSQL hosting
- **Replit**: Development environment and deployment platform

### Major NPM Packages
- **Frontend**: React, React Query, Wouter, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- **Backend**: Express, Drizzle ORM, Firebase Admin SDK
- **Development**: Vite, TypeScript, ESBuild

### Authentication Flow
- Firebase client SDK handles user authentication
- Server validates Firebase ID tokens using Admin SDK
- User profiles stored in PostgreSQL with Firebase UID mapping

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with HMR and Express backend
- **Environment Variables**: Firebase config, database URL, Gemini API key
- **Database**: Development database connection via Drizzle

### Production Deployment
- **Build Process**: Vite builds React app, ESBuild bundles server
- **Static Assets**: Client build served by Express in production
- **Environment**: Node.js production environment with optimized builds
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit handles schema updates

### Configuration Requirements
- Firebase project credentials (Admin SDK)
- Google Gemini API key
- PostgreSQL database connection string
- Environment-specific configuration variables

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between client and server responsibilities, leveraging managed services for authentication and AI processing while maintaining full control over the core application logic and data storage.
